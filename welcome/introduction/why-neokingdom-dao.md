# Why NEOKingdom DAO?

Imagine a world where work is not a burden that rules our lives but a source of fulfillment and purpose that fits around our lives.

We believe it is time to challenge the traditional employment model and to ensure that our finite time is spent meaningfully.

We believe the future of work can be entirely reimagined if collaboration moves away from traditional company structures, to collaborating as Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), due to their emphasis on shared decision-making and ownership, one that favors all rather than the few.

While DAOs are increasingly common, the legal piece is often an afterthought and one that comes too late in the creation of a DAO. We are dedicated to working with governments and regulators to create legally compliant DAOs by providing a clear framework that ‘regular’ businesses can adopt. We want to lower the barrier to entry for both Web3 and traditional organizations.
