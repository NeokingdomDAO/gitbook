# How do we do it?

We have established a legal and technical framework to operate as a DAO. We worked closely with the Estonian government, and our token structure has been analyzed by one of the big four consulting companies. We are a “wrapped” DAO that pays taxes, has a bank account, and is capable of helping other organizations to do the same.&#x20;

Contributors are rewarded for their contribution based on the time they invest in it. Rather than being paid in the traditional sense, contributors are rewarded with tokens, which can be likened to holding shares in a traditional company - with a difference. These tokens give access to ownership, governance (voting) and dividend rights.

We strongly believe in the value of mainstream adoption of DAOs. That is why we chose a business outside of the Web3 realm as the pilot project to test our framework. Teledisko, the smallest disco in the world, transformed from a German Limited Liability Company to the first Neokingdom.

It worked.&#x20;
