# Voting

As core members of the DAO, Contributors can participate in DAO voting, meaning they can play a role in the governing of the DAO. Voting rights are not distributed evenly among the shareholders of DAO but instead, correlate to the amount of NEOK held by each voting-eligible shareholder and the respective rights of each of the categories of shareholders. A Contributor can also delegate their voting right to another Contributor.&#x20;
