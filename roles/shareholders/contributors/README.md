# Contributors

There are three types of shareholders of the NEOKingdom DAO, each with different&#x20;

rights and obligations (as stated in the Articles of Association of the DAO).  A Shareholder shall always hold only 1 share of DAO with a nominal value of 1 Euro. A Shareholder is prohibited from acquiring additional shares.

Any individual interested in participating in the NEOKingdom DAO can submit their KYC and other relevant documents to the DAO. If the person is approved, they will be gifted 1 share of the NEOKingdom DAO.&#x20;

A Contributor is a shareholder of NEOKingdom DAO who, by a resolution of the majority of shareholders, has been given the right to contribute time to the DAO. Their contributions are tracked in time, which triggers the minting of NEOK tokens. These tokens give access to ownership, dividends, and voting rights in the DAO.&#x20;

Of the three categories of shareholders, Contributors have both the widest rights as shareholders and the most restrictions:

* they must be KYC-compliant and entered into the shareholdersâ€™ register;
* they must be natural persons;
* they can contribute time and receive NEOK in return;
* they can invest money and receive NEOK in return;
* they can propose new resolutions for consideration by the DAO;
* they have the right to vote on resolutions;
* they have the right to receive profit (based on the number of NEOK they hold);
* they have the right to buy NEOK from other contributors on the internal market with a fixed price of 1 NEOK = 1 EUR;
* they cannot sell NEOK on the secondary market without offering NEOK before to other contributors with a fixed price of 1 NEOK = 1 EUR;
* their NEOK is taken into account while calculating the allotment of the NEOKingdom DAO ownership, governance, and dividend rights between all of its members.
