# Investors

Any individual interested in participating in the NEOKingdom DAO as an Investor can submit their KYC and other relevant documents to the DAO. If the person is approved, they will be gifted 1 share of the NEOKingdom DAO.&#x20;

Any tokens they receive for their investment give them access to ownership and dividend distribution of the DAO. A Regular Investor or an Impact Investor can freely transfer their tokens between blockchain addresses and dispose of them without any restrictions.

This holder type is the entry point for everyone interested in participating in NEOKingdom DAO:

* they must be KYC-compliant and entered into the shareholders register;
* they can be natural persons or entities;
* they can invest money and receive NEOK in return;
* they have the right to receive profit (based on the number of NEOK they hold);
* they can sell NEOK on the secondary market whenever they want;
* their NEOK is taken into account while calculating the allotment of the NEOKingdom DAO ownership and dividend rights, but not governance rights, between all of its members.

### Voting&#x20;

Investors have a right to receive dividends, but unlike Contributors, they do not have voting rights, meaning they are not able to play a role in the governing of the DAO.

### Exiting

A Regular Investor can leave the DAO at any time, without any restrictions, by notifying the DAO and gifting back or selling back their share of the DAO at their nominal value of 1 Euro per share.
