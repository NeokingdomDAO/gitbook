# Impact Investors

There are three types of shareholders of the NEOKingdom DAO, each with different&#x20;

rights and obligations (as stated in the Articles of Association of the DAO). A Shareholder shall always hold only 1 share of DAO with the nominal value of 1 Euro. A Shareholder is prohibited to acquire additional shares.

Any individual interested in participating in the NEOKingdom DAO as an Investor can submit their KYC and other relevant documents to the DAO. If the person is approved, they will be gifted 1 share of the NEOKingdom DAO. A Shareholder shall always hold only 1 share of DAO with the nominal value of 1 Euro and is prohibited from acquiring additional shares.

An Impact Investor or Regular Investor can freely transfer their tokens between blockchain addresses and dispose of them without any restrictions.

### Voting&#x20;

Of the three types of shareholders, Impact Investors and Contributors can participate in DAO voting, meaning they can play a role in the governing of the DAO. Voting rights are not distributed evenly among the shareholders of DAO, but instead correlate to the amount of NEOK held by each voting-eligible shareholder.

An Impact Investor may delegate their voting right to a Contributor, or to another Impact Investor.

### Exiting

An Impact Investor can leave the DAO at any time, without any restrictions, by notifying the DAO and gifting back or selling back their share of the DAO at their nominal value of 1 Euro per share.
