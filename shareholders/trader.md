# Trader

A trader is someone who has acquired NEOK tokens from the secondary market for trading purposes and has no connection to NEOKingdom DAO. They are not DAO shareholders (i.e. Contributor, Investor, Impact Investor).

* No KYC is required to be a Trader of NEOK
* Traders can sell NEOK on the secondary market whenever they want
* The NEOK tokens held by Traders are not taken into account while calculating the allotment of the NEOKingdom DAO ownership, governance, or dividend rights between all of its members.

If a Trader wants to get involved in the NEOKingdom DAO, they can apply to become Investors or Contributors and at this time, would be required to submit their KYC documents.&#x20;
