# What is the constitution?

The Constitution is a set of principles and goals of the NEOCommonwealth being followed by the NEOKingdom DAO and all the joined NEOKingdoms. The constitution has not yet been published. However, one example of such a constitution is emerging in the EVMOS project on which the first implementation of a NEOKingdom DAO is built. https://docs.evmos.vision/constitution
