The NEOKingdom DAO – 2022 recap by Benjamin von Uphues

Where shall one start to tell a story? From the beginning? The End? Or go right down the middle?

The beginning was actually quite some time ago in Summer 2016. Based on the simple assumption that the most precious asset all humans own (besides our health of course) is our life time itself. We can chose to waste it, use it or invest it.

Anyone who decides to invest their life time into creating and growing something, which may turn out very valuable, should be considered equal if not more appreciated than just monetary investment.

This is the core purpose and narrative of the NEOKingdom DAO. Contributors invest their time. Time is tracked using the NEOKingdom DAPP. Each month tokens are minted and distributed to the contributors based on completed and approved tasks.

The contributor can then choose to either keep the tokens which represent ownership, dividend and voting rights in the DAO, or exchange them for any other currency to pay bills if needed based on some legally clearly defined principles.

The end is simple! We did it! While self congratulation too is a form of celebration, with humble modesty it is noted that we are by far not done yet. What did we achieve and how did we get there?

Let’s start with the big decisions we made this year which will shape our future:

On July 23 2022 we deployed our prototype. teledisko DAO. Incorporated as an Estonian limited. It required a legal foundation which consists of mainly two documents: The Articles of Association (AoA) and the Shareholders agreement SHA).

Marko Talur from Oblicity, an Estonian legal advisor has accomplished this monumental task in several years of work.

Secondly but not less important was the technical implementation of those legal documents in form of Solidity smart contracts in conjunction with a DAPP front- end. Developed by Alberto Granzotto and Nicola Miotto our core tech team along with Stefano Ceschi Berrini a magnificent team of Italian cyber-punks with strong core values.

Leading up to the deployment of the fully legal and functioning prototype the inevitable question which technical ecosystem to deploy to was a long and difficult assessment. When the pin dropped it was EVMOS as part of the greater, IBC enabled, Cosmos.

On 23.07.2022 the entire team came together in our ‘airshipcastle’ in Berlin to deploy, vote and execute without a hitch, and then celebrate this mayor milestone.

The next big decision was to participate in the EVMOS Momentum hackathon which was rewarded with a clear victory in form of the 2. price. https://devpost.com/software/teledisko-dao

The logical next milestone was a physical core team summit in the beginning of November 2022 in our ‘airshipcastle’. We discussed and evaluated our learning from using and experimenting with our ‘teledisko DAO’ prototype. As a side note ([www.teledisko.com](http://www.teledisko.com/)) is a successful and highly visible real world business. It has contributed most of it’s resources over 6 years developing what in the ultimate step in 2022 has now become the neokingdom DAO.

During the summit the core founding team of Marko Talur, Alberto Granzotto, Nicola Miotto and Benjamin von Uphues were able to agree on the commitment to the idea and a road-map forward based on following definitions and mission statement:

The NeoCommonwealth is a confederation of the Neokingdom DAO and all the Neokingdoms acting together for collective strength.

The Neokingdom DAO is the Crown of the NeoCommonwealth being governed by all the Neokingdoms.

A Neokingdom is an entity that chooses to obey the Constitution enforcing a purpose driven, sustainable and collaborative approach to value creation.

The Constitution is a set of principles and goals of the NeoCommonwealth being followed by the Neokingdom DAO and all the Neokingdoms.

DAOcracy is a new type of governance emerging from the combination of technical evolution and decentralization of organizations.

MISSION STATEMENT

The mission of the NeoCommonwealth is to recognize the energy, enthusiasm and contribution of individual´s time as an asset that should be considered as an investment. This will be achieved by adopting a new type of governance model – DAOcracy. Fostering this concept will create a better existence for everyone on planet Earth.

The next step on the road map, which was then slated for 21.12.2022 was the formation and foundation of the NEOkingdom DAO as the crown to foster the entire ecosystem.

* In the meantime Marko Talur got really busy crafting the new documents and working out the legal details.
* Simultaneously one of the big four consulting companies is working on a legal assessment that the NEOKindom DAO Token (neok) is NOT a security.
* The tech team shipped the automation of the monthly token minting.
* The secondary marked module gained priority.
* Build a custom oracle to integrate with the EEuro stable coin.
* We integrated the NEOKingdom DAPP into the latest version of our ERP open source software Odoo (Enterprise Resource Planning) which we use as the database for time tracking, tasks and projects. Peter Schwarz is our Odoo lead.
* We contracted and completed the creation of our Corporate Identity (CI)
* We met in Estonia to discuss the details for the on-boarding of Metawalls DAO ([www.metawalls.io](http://www.metawalls.io/)) as the next joining DAO after teledisko DAO and neokingdom DAO.
* The entire team becoming Estonian E-citizen to be able to establish NEOKingdom DAO from anywhere in the world remotely one of the key features of Estonia as the base.

21.12.2022 came and within one phone call NEOKingdom DAO was established. We now have all the pieces together to peel out of our 6 year stealth mode. If this is your first time reading about it, welcome home!

We are looking forward to being a vital part of the EVMOS and Cosmos Ecosystems. We will contribute to emerging constitutions to eventually adapt and adopt one. We will release our secondary market module in the coming months, which will allow for contributor earned tokens to hit the secondary market.

We encourage everyone to consider your current status QUO. Are you still being exploited by creating value that someone else benefits from, or are you taking care of yourself by valuing your own most precious life time?
