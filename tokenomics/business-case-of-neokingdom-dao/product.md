NEOKingdom DAO is developing the legal and technical framework (hereinafter: Framework) required to create and manage a new type of elevated organizations, which we call "neokingdoms." A neokingdom is a DAO wrapped into a limited liability company incorporated in Estonia that uses our tested custom Articles of Association, Shareholders' Agreement, and blockchain-based technical solution for governance. All members of a neokingdom are also the shareholders of a respective underlying private limited company. 

The Framework is first developed and deployed at NEOKingdom DAO and then offered to neokingdoms with individualized modifications. The Framework is built on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and is legally compliant. Within the Framework, DAO members can vote and interact with their DAO by using the progressive web app developed by NEOKingdom DAO.

To ensure the effectiveness of the proposed Framework, we have adopted it ourselves, testing it every day. On July 27th, 2022, the founders of NEOKingdom DAO transformed their existing brick-and-mortar company, teledisko GmbH, into the first neokingdom. We have been using this experience to refine the Framework to better address challenges and make the Framework available to every type of business in the future.

Currently, there are two active entities using the Framework: teledisko DAO OÜ, launched on July 27th, 2022, as a pilot project of the concept, and NEOKingdom DAO OÜ, launched in December 2022. There are 3-5 other companies in the pipeline to join the Framework as neokingdoms in 2023.
