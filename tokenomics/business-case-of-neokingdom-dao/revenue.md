NEOKingdom DAO provides the Framework to neokingdoms for the exchange of a share in them. Therefore, the success and profit of NEOKingdom DAO are directly connected to the success of all neokingdoms together (creating an ecosystem that we call NEOCommonwealth). It is important that even if a neokingdom does not earn profit and therefore does not pay dividends to NEOKingdom DAO, there will be a capital gain in case of a profitable exit of the neokingdom.

It is important to note that, while tested and already in production, many of the new concepts involved in the Framework are experimental, and the consequences and actual user behavior still need to stand the long-term test.
