# Solution

The solution is to redefine the meaning of an investor. NEOKingdom DAO starts rewarding contributors with ownership, governance, and dividend rights on an equal basis, so they would also own part of what they create daily. Contributors may also choose to dispose of their rights, like other shareholders if they need fiat money for expenses or decide to leave the DAO. This creates a level playing field between contributors investing their time and founders, investors, and other shareholders investing their money.
