# NEOK Holder Types

NEOKingdom DAO has four types of NEOK holders, each with different rights and obligations. This diverse holder base allows for an inclusive and thriving community that supports the growth and success of NEOKingdom DAO.

Holder types are divided between two major groups: KYC-compliant holders with access to core functionalities of the Framework, and generic holders, who hold tokens for trading purposes outside the Framework.
