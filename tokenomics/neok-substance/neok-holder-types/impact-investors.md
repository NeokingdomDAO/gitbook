# Impact Investors

Very rare and specifically negotiated persons whose investment has such an importance to NEOKingdom DAO that those persons have voting right although they are not contributors:

* they must be KYC-compliant and entered into the shareholders register;
* they can be natural persons or entities;
* they can invest money and receive NEOK in return;
* they have the right to vote on resolutions (based on the number of NEOK they hold);
* they have the right to receive profits (based on the number of NEOK they hold);
* they can sell NEOK on the secondary market whenever they want;
* their NEOK is taken into account while calculating the allotment of the NEOKingdom DAO ownership, governance, and dividend rights between all of its members.
