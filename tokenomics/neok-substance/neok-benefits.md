# NEOK Benefits

Benefits related to holding NEOK depend on the holderâ€™s classification:

1. Contributors will own a fair part of the business they are spending their time on. They also have the possibility to direct NEOKingdom DAO on a daily basis by voting on resolutions and earning dividends from annual profits. In case of a need for fiat money, they can decide to sell part of their ownership rights at any time. Upon market failure, contributors can redeem a limited number of NEOK against NEOKingdom DAO to pay for daily expenses;
2. Investors will be entitled to dividends from annual profits and receive a capital gain if the price of NEOK rises. As NEOK gives access to ownership, an investor can evaluate the actual value that NEOKingdom DAO creates and make investment and NEOK price decisions on the secondary market based on that;
3. Impact investors have the right to direct NEOKingdom DAO on a daily basis by voting on resolutions. They are also entitled to all the benefits of investors;
4. Traders have the possibility to make short or long-term investments into NEOK with the expectation to gain from the rise of NEOK price without any connection to NEOKingdom DAO.

In summary, NEOK is designed to create a diverse and thriving ecosystem that rewards mostly KYC-compliant holders for their time contributions, fosters active participation of investors, and encourages token trading from outsiders to support the growth and success of the DAO.
